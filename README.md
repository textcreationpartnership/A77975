#The vvofull cry of unjust persecutions, and grevious oppressions of the people of God in England, through the injustice of some of her rulers, and wikednesse of teachers and people, who hasten to fulfil the measure of their forefathers cruelty. With a lamentation over them all who rewards the Lord evill for good, and is a warning to them all for repentance; shewing that the coming of the Lord is nigh. And this may serve for an answer in full, to all such who have persecuted by violence, by word or writing the innocent people in scorn called Quakers. With a short addition, which shewes unto all, the ground of persecution; in its first cause, and the enmity which is betwixt the two seeds, is clearly discovered, by a friend to the suffering seed of God, E.B.#
